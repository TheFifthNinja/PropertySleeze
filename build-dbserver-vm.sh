# By default, MySQL only listens for local network requests,
# i.e., that originate from within the dbserver VM. We need to
# change this so that the webserver VM can connect to the
# database on the dbserver VM. Use of `sed` is pretty obscure,
# but the net effect of the command is to find the line
# containing "bind-address" within the given `mysqld.cnf`
# configuration file and then to change "127.0.0.1" (meaning
# local only) to "0.0.0.0" (meaning accept connections from any
# network interface).
sed -i'' -e '/bind-address/s/127.0.0.1/0.0.0.0/' /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

# We then restart the MySQL server to ensure that it picks up
# our configuration changes.
